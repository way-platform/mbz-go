    description: 'The Push API allows you to receive vehicle signals and vehicle command responses for the active services of your vehicles.

        From a technical point of view, a service is used to activate or deactivate a data package and/or commands for a vehicle. Each data package contains a set of vehicle signals or a vehicle command response.

        Some of the provided signals require optional equipment in the vehicle, such as tire pressure sensors or anti theft equipment. In case equipment is not available, the signals can not be sent by the vehicle.

        Please note, not all services, data signals and commands are available for every vehicle and all countries.
